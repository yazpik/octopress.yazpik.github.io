  <div class="entry-content"><h3><strong><em> Demotivation of Innovation </em></strong></h3>

<p><img src="/images/lops/cloud-domination.jpg" width="650" height="550" title="'Our idea of Cloud computing back in 2014'" ></p>

<p>Last night having a beer with my friend <a href="http://arturoochoa.wordpress.com">Arturo Ochoa</a> we were talking about what really motivates you to innovate and/or create something that help fixing problems.
We were not sure what is all about,
but we felt same way, when you are doing it, you always think whatever you are implementing it does really suck, ..maybe not creating something new, your skills are not enough, etc. etc
But the reality is that maybe nobody is doing anything about it, and find yourself as the only one with you poor skills trying to do something different.
We tent to underestimate our efforts in a really bad way, and maybe that stop us going to the next level&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share my story, how I learnt by doing and I&rsquo;ll say trying to simplifying things and solving existing problems using OpenStack as a platform.</p>

<p>-Back in 2013 on my former employer I had plenty of time due I got some storage skills on my position, as a Sr Storage Engineer at that time being. Not too much automated stuff but enough to give me time to learn something else.
Bash, Perl, ssh-keys and one big xls file involved here :)</p>

<p>-I started testing Openstack (Grizzly) and Eucaliptus on my own laptop but didn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>

<p>-I heard some guys from the same company but in Slovakia, were trying to connect Netapp as backend storage on an OpenStack test cloud. &ndash; I offered my help but I got rejected.</p>

<p>-So I continued on my self learning pace.</p>

<p>-One of my previous managers wanted a solution to store files on the internal network, I offered him some help and he
gave me 3 very old servers and one disk array. Just for the records &ndash; <strong><em>never finished what he really wanted.</em></strong></p>

<p>-Managed to build one server from 3 I got, a very old Proliant G4 with 12GB of RAM and 2 CPUs at 2.4GHz, and a Disk array with 5 failed disks of 12, and suddenly <strong>Nazgul01</strong> was born.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/lab02.jpg" width="350" height="550" title="'lab'" ></p>

<p><strong>-I felt like I have something here</strong></p>

<p>-Got access to the electronic Junk and trash, hardware listed to be donated by my previous employer.</p>

<p>-In the meantime annoyed my co-workers with really noise old and dusty hardware from the cracks.</p>

<p>-For some reason big companies tent to underestimate a &ldquo;barrio bajo&rdquo; guy with roedor skills, to find usable hardware
So one idiot from networking team, throw to the trash a Cisco Catalyst switch, I took it, test it, configured and failed configuring it like ten times, the idiot was not longer an idiot, and I realized something was wrong with the switch. my intern number 2 managed to rebuilt the OS for me, and it worked very nicely supporting jumbo frames&hellip; so intern wins, and I was just another idiot.</p>

<p>-Also from the trash, found 4xG5 Proliants, lead to built 3 &ldquo;<em>decents</em>&rdquo; servers using the parts of those 4.</p>

<p><strong>-I felt, invincible.. and dusty</strong></p>

<p>-Realized I needed some extra help, my Linux skills were not as good as I thought anymore, due I spent a lot of time playing with a SAN appliance.
So I sent an email to my friend <a href="https://karkul.github.io">Ramon Morales</a>, if he would like to join me, and I got an email from him five minutes later with a &ldquo; <strong>let&rsquo;s fucking do it!</strong> &rdquo;  or something like that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/lab03.jpg" width="350" height="550" title="'lab'" ></p>

<p>-We spent several days trying to Install Openstack in 3 nodes not even configure it.
One month mark passed and we started to think this Openstack thing was a myth because we failed and failed
and&hellip;&hellip;.failed.</p>

<p><strong>So we started to read manuals&hellip;.</strong></p>

<p>-Like two months later, we were able to spin up our first instance running CirrOS.
and <strong>Booooom</strong> an inovation explosion just happened.</p>

<p><strong>-We felt unstopable</strong></p>

<p>We can even were able to launch virtual instances from a mobile phone, using a VPN, see images below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/cloudportal_movil.png" width="650" height="400" title="'lab'" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/cloudportal_movil2.png" width="650" height="450" title="'lab'" ></p>

<p>-We have had a lot of ideas, we learnt as we use it, that platform was awesome&hellip; with a lot of patches and networking hacks but awesome,
none of us managed vmware previously, also we didn&rsquo;t understand the disadvantages against vmware at that time.</p>

<p>-I attended a meeting with the Innovation department, excited and wanted to show them our little monster.</p>

<p>When a big company has a solution for years, and sell that solution in millions of dollars,
and always have been successful, everything is running flawlessly..
<strong>Why other platform that was buggy, without support, complex, and SAP is not certifiying your crap could have place in this company?</strong></p>

<p>Basically that was the output from that meeting&hellip;</p>

<p>-You can be really demoralized after a meeting like that, but sometimes I&rsquo;m stubborn as fuck&hellip;
At the end of October 2014, We ended up releasing our very first buggy version of OpenStack based on Juno.  <strong>CATRINA</strong> was born..</p>

<p>We offered some instances for Trial &amp; Demo, -Hey free virtual instances with no internet access for free!
None, nadie, nobody&hellip;</p>

<p>-Some sort of support
At least one guy of the management team saw something on our idea, he supported us with 4 more servers, that we can use our little monster as compute nodes.
then this guy joined SAP team, and suggested them to use our platform for learning SAP porpuses.
We started serving cloud services for SAP, with the power of OpenStack, very easy and fast, performance was really good,
nobody complained they never thought their instances were running on a test platform managed from some linux hippies.
We ran SAP Bussiness Object, SAP Solman, SAP W-something, and belive or not <strong>SAP HANA.</strong></p>

<p>Our next releases were</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TYRION</strong> &ndash; A clever version with automated bootstraping, and PXE.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MUTANT</strong> Using CEPH with a crappy disk array built from the junk as well, but it was running great.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And we started to make some noise back then,
We got a meeting with some of the high level managers, we showed them our monster, and&hellip; <strong>we didn&rsquo;t meet their expectactions by far.</strong></p>

<p>They were thinking on an enhanced version of VMware, and we failed to explained them in a non technical way why we think this technology could help the company saving money and time.</p>

<p>They said we need a TCO, Bussines Cases and so on, &hellip;again believe or not, we built a TCO and a BC with our poor financial skills, even a freaking promotional video.

<p><img src="/images/lops/produccion2.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="'Video'" ></p>

<p>But for some reason it wasn&rsquo;t not enough, here are the results</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SF5rz2rdBLs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<h4>OpenStack Summit in Vancouver 2015 &ndash; Cloud or die.</h4>

<p>So we took our savings, booked the cheapest hotel we found in Vancouver downtown, bought flight tickets, got Canadian VISA approved, and boooom we were in Canada with no support from our employer.</p>

<p>We learnt a lot about new concepts, new technologies, we met interesting and smart people, we had fun, and even <strong>Ramon got the OpenStack certification by Redhat</strong>, I tried but failed.. again  :) , just fun so we realized after that trip, this is the new thing, not Openstack but Cloud and containers revolution.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/vancouver2.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="'Vancouver'" ></p>

<h5>Spread the word!</h5>

<p>We were invited to gave some speeches on universities, ITESM, BUAP, Universidad Veracruzana, and we organized a SysAdminDay in our company.
By the end of 2015 one year later of Catrina creation,
We were considered by the management to attend the <strong>OPENTELEKOM Cloud</strong> technical talk in Budapest, Hungary. <strong>(we no longer use our own money to pay for beers on that trip)</strong> ,
OTC is a Deustche Telekom initiative to build a public cloud based on OpenStack to offer in the European Market.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/frankfurt3.jpg" width="650" height="650" title="'Frankfurt'" ></p>

<p>Also taking advantage of the long trip we had the opportunity to show a demo in Frankfurt, Germany, to some of the Senior Cloud engineers, pretty much how we managed to run OpenStack as an Enterprise private cloud, supporting all SAP toys, SAP HANA, Big Data with Hadoop, our progress with OpenStack + VMWare, and Docker.
we were able to launch a Hadoop cluster in just a few minutes, as I described on a previous post <a href="https://yazpik.github.io/blog/2015/11/16/bigdata-as-a-service/">Big Data as a Service</a> , that was by the end of the 2015.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lops/frankfurt.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="'Frankfurt'" ></p>

<p>We went back to Mexico with a good feedback from Germany and Hungary, and we were proud of what we have achieved so far, but not enough for us.</p>

<p>We always asked ourselfs</p>

<p><strong>Why as a company, as a country, we need to wait the innovation from USA, Europe or Asia? and not step up first, even when you have the resources and the customers&hellip;.</strong></p>

<p>So this OpenStack lab built from the junk, in less than two years took us to three different countries and a new continent for us.
We were wrong in so many levels, and failed to explain to the management our vision, perhaps.</p>

<p>The only thing we were not wrong, was about to learn new things and have fun by doing it, push our own limits, and do not underestimate what we built, at the end, no one else was doing it on our small environment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>When you are thankful that your family is close by</em> ..</p>

<p><em>When your real friends are always up for you</em> ..</p>

<p><em>When you have reached your comfort zone and stability</em> &hellip;</p>

<p>Personal and professional decisions, one of the hardest so far, We as a family decided to take the opportunity
and move from Puebla, Mexico to San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p>Yeah different country, different company, and a new  emerging technology, in which I&rsquo;ve been working very hard for the last two years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been so far a cultural shock even though we are very close to Mexico.
I&rsquo;ve broke my comfort zone many times before, But this time is my family with me.</p>

<p>This is a family experience and we will learn together, and support each other on this transition, I know is not going to be easy&hellip; But as people say here:</p>

<p> <strong>You Only Live Once&hellip;&hellip;.</strong></p>

<p>And also the fortune-cow knows.. and supports me :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>A complete elastic Hadoop cluster with OpenStack + Sahara in 15 minutes</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/bigdata.gif" width="650" height="650" title="'Dilbert Data Accuracy'" ></p>

<p>Hi there&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t been here for a while for several reasons, that includes a super hyperactive baby girl and a lot of effort building an Enterprise class ready Private cloud based in OpenStack using a tremendous set of new technologies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_storage" title="SDS">SDS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking" title="SDN">SDN</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29" title="Iaas">IaaS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29" title="PaaS">PaaS</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/" title="Docker">Containers</a>, <a href="http://go.sap.com/solution/in-memory-platform.html">Hana</a> and now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">BigData</a>.
the good thing is, working along with a talented guy as <a href="https://twitter.com/karkull" title="Karkull">Ramon Morales</a> things are easier to do, brainwork becomes a hobbie on a playground and innovation just flows.
but anyway let&rsquo;s jump on the BigData stuff.</p>

<p>One of our DBA&rsquo;s ask us for a Linux instance on the OpenStack cloud, first questions from me was, purpose ? , so he wanted to try and learn about Hadoop, so I started to look if there was an image ready for it or start to build one from scratch and meet the Hadoop pre-requisites, at the end the DBA won&rsquo;t install the Hadoop platform, that will be the sysadmins or Devops :)
So I was on an interesting situation, reading in deep I found a pararell world about DataProcessing and BigData, and then project <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Sahara/">Sahara</a> formerly known as Savanna, immediatly I get caught on it.</p>

<p>But WHAT IS SAHARA?</p>

<p>Sahara began life as an Apache 2.0 project and is now an OpenStack integrated project, Sahara enables the fast provisioning and easy management of Hadoop clusters on Openstack, mainstream Hadoop distributions and elastic data processing (EDP) capability similar to Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR).</p>

<p>So here are basic steps to add Sahara on an existing OpenStack deployment.</p>

<p>On the OpenStack control Node (ubuntu)
I started searching the packages for Sahara first, didn&rsquo;t break anything on control nodes :)</p>

<pre>
$ sudo apt-cache search sahara
</pre>


<p>That gets me sahara, python-saharaclient, and openstack-dashboard, I already have the dashboard installed, so just needed to install sahara package and the python-saharaclient.</p>

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install sahara python-saharaclient
</pre>


<p>Find out the sahara configuratin file, default path is /etc/sahara, there are some samples placed in the sahara directory, you can use the basic sample or generate a new one with</p>

<pre>
$ sudo tox -e genconfig
</pre>


<p>That will get you a sahara.conf file, you can modify basic parameters, such as Networking(Neutron), Database(Mysql), Message systems(Rabbit), Identity(Keystone), for a reference guide please see: <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/sahara/userdoc/configuration.guide.html" title="Sahara config guide">Sahara Configuration Guide</a></p>

<p>Then a Database Schema for Shara is needed, you can create it as follows (on an existing empty database)</p>

<pre>
$ sudo sahara-db-manage --config-file /etc/sahara/sahara.conf upgrade head  
</pre>


<p>my db connection string on sahara.conf file is</p>

<p><figure class='code'><figcaption>sahara.conf (snippet)</figcaption><div class='highlight'><table><tr><td class='line-numbers' aria-hidden='true'><pre><div data-line='1' class='line-number'></div></pre></td><td class='main  bash'><pre><div class='line'><span class="nv">connection</span><span class="o">=</span>mysql://admin:ridiculouspass@localhost:3306/saharadb
</div></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Great, we have a database schema for Sahara, please make sure Database hosts is reacheable by sahara node and neutron management network.</p>

<h5>Keystone configuration</h5>

<p>This is another essencial part for sahara to be accesible in the OpenStack dasboard and for python sahara client to work properly we need to add sahara on keystone catalog</p>

<p>As keystone admin, create the service &ldquo;sahara&rdquo; as data_processing type</p>

<pre>
(keystone_admin)# keystone service-create --name sahara --type data_processing \
    --description "Sahara Data Processing"
</pre>


<p>Next create the endpoint and define the access + Region</p>

<pre>
(keystone_admin)# keystone endpoint-create --service sahara --region RegionOne \
    --publicurl "http://172.16.0.2:8386/v1.1/%(tenant_id)s" \
    --adminurl "http://10.0.0.2:8386/v1.1/%(tenant_id)s" \
    --internalurl "http://192.168.0.2:8386/v1.1/%(tenant_id)s"
</pre>


<p>Make sue you match the admin, public and internal network on the new service, you can verify the current endpoints with</p>

<pre>
(keystone_admin)# keystone endpoint-list
</pre>


<h5>Configure Firewall to Allow Sahara service traffic</h5>

<p>Add an INPUT rule allowing TCP traffic on port 8386, and restart iptables</p>

<pre>
-A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 8386 -j ACCEPT
</pre>


<p>Start Sahara service</p>

<pre>
    service sahara-all start
</pre>


<p>Also you can setup Sahara on a virtual python environment, I didn&rsquo;t try that, but can be found here
<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/sahara/userdoc/installation.guide.html#to-install-into-a-virtual-environment">Sahara Virtualenv</a></p>

<p>There are also advanced configurations for Sahara, you can find them here
<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/sahara/userdoc/advanced.configuration.guide.html">Sahara Advanced configuration</a></p>

<p>That is a high level steps for Sahara in OpenStack, so once we have them all and you can see Data Processing panel on Horizon, so from here 15 minutes can start to count to create a cutting-edge fresh hadoop cluster.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/01_Hadoop.png" width="200" height="600" title="" ></p>

<p>Then there are some pre-configured images for Hadoop vanilla plugin, you can download them from here
<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/sahara/userdoc/vanilla_plugin.html">Vanilla Plugin</a></p>

<p>And it can be easily upload to glance, then to the Data processing image registry
<img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/02_hadoop.png" width="600" height="200" title="" ></p>

<p>Sahara makes it possible to create nodes and cluster templates, You can mix and match roles for a node, also you can scale out your cluster as many or few nodes you need.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/03_hadoop.png" width="600" height="200" title="" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/05_hadoop.png" width="400" height="200" title="" ></p>

<p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t say it better than mirantis.com</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manually creating a Hadoop cluster on OpenStack requires spinning up instances, installing Hadoop on each instance, configuring the instances to work together, specifying the namenode, jobtracker, tasktrackers, and any storage nodes, and configuring each of hundreds, or even thousands, of nodes. Why spend all that time on manual configuration — with the possibility of human error — when you can use Sahara to specify node characteristics and roles, click to deploy, and access a individual or multiple robust, stable Hadoop clusters in parallel with minimal delay?&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/07_hadoop.png" width="600" height="200" title="" ></p>

<p>Also the Hadoop cluster can be scalable with no pain, so you can save time
when it comes to create and configure new nodes, only simply add node types by the OpenStack Sahara user interface</p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/11_hadoop.gif" width="600" height="200" title="" ></p>

<p>And voila you have a fresh Elastic Hadoop deployment ready in just a few minutes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/10_hadoop.png" width="500" height="200" title="" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/09_hadoop.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/Hadoop_Post/08_hadoop.png" width="600" height="300" title="" ></p>

<p>So this is pretty much everything about the installation of Hadoop on OpenStack (Juno)
Next post We&rsquo;ll run a job on the cluster, stay tunned :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Or the containerization of the cloud</h4>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/kubernetes.jpeg" width="350" height="350" title="'Kubernetes'" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, Openstack and Containers are no enemies, and they are not fighting at all,
Those two technologies are a powerful combination bringing the best of &ldquo;two worlds&rdquo; but in different layers of the stack, maybe combining them does not make sense,but actually it really does.</p>

<p>Combining Openstack + Heat + Murano + Kubernetes it does sounds really complex but actually is becoming the opossite
I want to share with you an interesting article from OpenStack SuperUser website, during the kubernetes meetup in San Francisco, there was a live demo where it was demostrated how to deploy a <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes</a> cluster in minutes with OpenStack and Murano.
<a href="http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-kubernetes-more-choice-and-flexibility-for-developers">http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-kubernetes-more-choice-and-flexibility-for-developers</a></p>

<p>Also <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/">Mirantis</a> is collaborating with Google to have a better integration of Kubernetes with OpenStack.
<a href="https://www.mirantis.com/company/press-center/company-news/mirantis-collaborates-google-kubernetes-openstack-integration/">https://www.mirantis.com/company/press-center/company-news/mirantis-collaborates-google-kubernetes-openstack-integration/</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/coreos-logo.png" width="350" height="350" title="'CoreOS'" ></p>

<p>The guys from <a href="https://coreos.com">CoreOS</a> have already take significant advantage, they are running several projects inside CoreOS, just to mention some, <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">Etcd</a>, <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://coreos.com/using-coreos/clustering/">Fleet</a>, all of them written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> language, helping to automatize and do things easy specially for developers delivering a powerful platform of containers.
This topic deserve a more descriptive post, and I&rsquo;ll try to do it soon, In the meantime If you are interested to try CoreOS with all the nice stuff give it a try to <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, they have put togheter some vagrant scripts to deploy a 3 nodes CoreOs cluster.</p>

<p>And for the lucky ones that are going to OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, there is going to be plenty of talks covering containers, actually is a full day about it, just to have an idea what big is this Hot-Topic.</p>

<p>The containerization of the cloud is becoming huge, and is going to change how we understand the definition of the cloud these days.</p>

<p>See you in Vancouver!</p>

<p>The OpenCompute Summit 2015 has just finished and there are some interesting talks from the top companies such Intel, Facebook, Linux, foundation, Microsoft and Rackspace.
For the ones that haven&rsquo;t heard about OpenCompute project, let me explain you with what is this about.</p>

<h4>From OpenCompute.org</h4>

<blockquote><p>"The Open Compute Project Foundation is a rapidly growing community of engineers around the world whose mission is to design and enable the delivery of the most efficient server, storage and data center hardware designs for scalable computing. We believe that openly sharing ideas, specifications and other intellectual property is the key to maximizing innovation and reducing operational complexity in the scalable computing space."</p></blockquote>


<p>Believe it or not this is a Facebook initiative to share the design of datacenter architecture with the intention to improve efficiency on servers, storage and also general datacenter overall infrastructure with smart and &ldquo;ecofriendly&rdquo; deployments.
I&rsquo;d say this is like an OpenSource project applied in hardware and is going to speed up the innovation on new hardware solutions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/opencomputeserver-750.jpg" width="360" height="140" title="'OpenCompute Servers'" >
<img src="/images/IODatacenter.jpg" width="360" height="140" title="'IO Datacenter in Scottsdale'" ></p>

<p>Big names just joined to the OpenCompute project such as Apple and HP, So I believe in the next two years or so we will see a drastical change on Datacenter deployments as well as compute architecture, and we have to be ready to be competitive or much better be part of it, this is a good opportunity to join as one of the early adopters.</p>

<p>So Does anyone out there is already working on OCP hardware? I&rsquo;d be really interested to participate in something like that.</p>

<p>Most of the talks are already on OpenCompute youtube channel, I&rsquo;m gonna share some of the most remarkables, I&rsquo;ve watched so far.</p>

<h5>Jay Parik VP of Engineering at Facebook.</h5>

<p>This is one of the most interesting talks, Facebook is saving $2 Billion US Dls on the last three years applying a full stack optmization on the Datacenter, Software and Networking based on OpenCompute, But forget about the money one of the things it really matters is that the energy conservation they made is equals to power up 80,000 homes per year and carbon emission reduction equals to 95,000 cars also per year, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you the rest watch by yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QBrRT0VpgY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QBrRT0VpgY</a></p>

<h5>Sam Ramji from Linux foundation</h5>

<p>He explain how OpenSource golden age can take place if we all collaborate in some way to create an OpenCloud platform, he made a point when Hortonworks went public with $1 Billion IPO using Hadoop and HDFS for Big Data, or Cloudera making $100M US Dls annual revenue to the other extreme when NTPd principal maintainer is making less than $20k per year, Well this is a must see talk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFfcCJcxlpk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFfcCJcxlpk</a></p>

<h5>Mark Shutterworth from Canonical</h5>

<p>He really knows where the technology is moving, Mark showed on a live demo, an OpenStack Lab deployed with MAAS running a Ceph cluster on top of a JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disk) system provided by Quanta (OpenCompute provider), and the power of containers with Kubernetes (OpenSource container cluster orchestration) from Google. .. have a look.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>&mdash;With the help of a real-life hacker</h3>

<p>A year ago while my wife was pregnant of my very first baby girl, I decided to build something special with my own hands for Naia, so I thought to build an small craddle, it seemed like an small project but I did not have any experience working with wood, I have to admit, it did sound crazy even for me, but possible.. why not?..
I started looking on internet in too many DIY (Do It Yourself) sites, woodworking for newbies, and also bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Childrens-Furniture-Projects-Step---Step/dp/1561585041/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425750403&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=childrens+furniture+projects">e-book</a> on amazon, finally I ended up with a couple of woodworking plans that seemed reasonable to my poor skills.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cuna/sketchy1.jpg" width="300" height="480" title="'Sketchy1'" >   <img src="/images/cuna/sketchy2.jpg" width="300" height="450" title="'Sketchy2'" ></p>

<p>Of course I couldn&rsquo;t build it by myself on my little space at home and no skills, So I threw an email to one of the most respectable and creative hacker nowadays, my friend <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~federico/">Federico Mena Quintero</a>, who has a passion for woodworking and a place to do it.
To people that haven&rsquo;t hear before about Federico, he is one of the most brilliant persons I have met, he has contributed with Opensource in so many levels an he is always trying to help the community, Let&rsquo;s say he should be in the &ldquo;hall of fame&rdquo; of the OpenSource history, besides that he is a young guy with a really lovely family.</p>

<p>Couple of days later I got Federico response, saying that he will be able to help me out with my &ldquo;little&rdquo; project!!! and we started some day back in Jan 2014, basically reviewing the woodworking plans and the options we had, Federico suggested me to &ldquo;Go big&rdquo; , he is also a father and knows the business of kids growing very fast, so we decided to build an actual crib that Naia can use at least until she turns six, and maybe can be passed on subsequent children, and then on and on throughout the family.</p>

<p>So we went out to the local wood place and got all we needed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cuna/IMG_0098.JPG" width="320" height="370" title="'Federico Mena'" >  <img src="/images/cuna/IMG_0102.JPG" width="400" height="300" title="'Truck loaded'" ></p>

<p>We started sanding pretty much everything by hand, no electric weapons were used to sand the wood.
Then we continue with front and end panels assembled</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The future of the storage</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working/playing with Storage systems since almost 4 years now, it&rsquo;s been a journey understand how things works on this side, I&rsquo;m a Netapp certified engineer on SAN environments now and personally speaking it was not hard to understand the Netapp world because my background is based in Linux and working with the cli is a day to day task, so my friend Reynaldo Pineda introduced me few storage concepts and useful commands for a week and the next week I was totally by my own supporting a production environment, at the end I could blame my manager if something went wrong to put an unexperienced guy behind the controls&hellip; :) But fortunately nothing happened, well played, weeeell played.</p>

<p>Going back to my journey on storage, I learnt a lot, and I was able to manage the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; for the sysadmins,
with more experience gained I faced ugly problems that cost me valuable time with family, celebrations, weekends, hollydays, and nights a lot of nights, but finally I got the point when I can do things easily, and my level of understanding how things works no matter the infraestructure was getting better.</p>

<p>But this is the point when you are a curious guy and you like to know what else is out there, well, I&rsquo;m surprised how technology advance minute to minute , it&rsquo;s a progressive and infinite science, &hellip;. I took a deep dive on SAN and Netapp Storage systems and when I looked back, the technology world surprisly changed, to be more specific on OpenSource Projects and Cloud.</p>

<p>Doing a bit of research I found a pretty darn interesting project called &ldquo;CEPH&rdquo; , it really blew my mind.
I was looking for an inexpensive storage solution for an &ldquo;small&rdquo; private cloud, and basically we found in Ceph everything that we needed, it&rsquo;s a distributed storage system, and it&rsquo;s OpenSource!, they claim to have a really good performance, reliability and scalability and indeed they have it all.
Ceph supports Object and Block storage, is integrated now on the Linux kernel, and the best thing, OpenStack included Ceph as well, Ceph also has its own filesystem (no yet ready for prod environments).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many roadblocks are out there, I know is going to be fun!</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_3183.JPG" width="550" height="550" title="'XamanEk'" ></p>

<p>Photo was taken during my first ride of the year, I woke up early in the morning while everybody was sleeping after new years dinner, took my motorcycle (Yamaha XT660Z Tenere) baptized as &ldquo;XamanEk&rdquo; and rode around 80km, 30% pavement 70% offroad on an exploratory route, from my wife&rsquo;s hometown to a Geothermal zone near to Tinajitas, Veracruz, It was not hard to find the place even its not in a map, just took me one stop asking people and rest was purely joy, I rode between hills, without a GPS (currently evaluating to get one), but at the end this is part of the fun of Adventure riding!</p>

<p>After a dip on crystal clear warm waters provided by mother earth, rode back with XamanEk just in time to had a lunch with the family.</p>

<p>2015 here we go!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a quick and easy guide to migrate VMWare VM&rsquo;s to OpenStack (KVM) using Redhat Enterprise 6.5</p>

<h4>Install virt-v2v</h4>

<p>The virt-v2v command converts virtual machines from a foreign hypervisor to run on KVM, managed by libvirt.</p>

<pre>
# yum install virt-v2v
</pre>


<p>Next step is create an xml file for the pool and indicate the storage path, I created a very simple xml file, like this one:</p>

<p><figure class='code'><figcaption>pool.xml</figcaption><div class='highlight'><table><tr><td class='line-numbers' aria-hidden='true'><pre><div data-line='1' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='2' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='3' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='4' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='5' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='6' class='line-number'></div></pre></td><td class='main  xml'><pre><div class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;pool</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;dir&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>virtimages<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;target&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>          <span class="nt">&lt;path&gt;</span>/home/images<span class="nt">&lt;/path&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;/target&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/pool&gt;</span>
</div></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Create an storage pool based on the xml file with virsh command and refeer the xml file</p>

<pre>
# virsh pool-create --file pool.xml
</pre>


<p>List the storage pool, &ldquo;virtimages&rdquo; pool is refering to the path given on the xml file which is /home/images</p>

<pre>
# virsh pool-list
</pre>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption>virsh output </figcaption><div class='highlight'><table><tr><td class='line-numbers' aria-hidden='true'><pre><div data-line='1' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='2' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='3' class='line-number'></div></pre></td><td class='main  vim'><pre><div class='line'>Name                 State      Autostart
</div><div class='line'><span class="p">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</span>
</div><div class='line'>virtimages           active       no
</div></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Create a .netrc file with ESX credentials, where the machine that you want to convert is hosted.</p>

<pre>
machine ESXi login root password s3cretitos
</pre>


<p>Convert the VMware VM to KVM, the virtual machine has to be stopped before to proceed with this, go to Virtual center and turn the VM off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Xacxamayo Episode 2</h4>

<p>I recently posted on my fb page about a visit to an small-remote town called Xacxamayo near to Puebla city,
Basically I was a volunteer for 3 saturdays,
I wanted to teach about other existing options on compute software, and also wanted to show them there is a world outside commercial and common programs, One of this options called Linux is currently helping in science, medicine, education and even in movies and games to not mention alot of different daylife stuff, I believe all of the kids were excited about the way I made my point.  :)</p>

<p>While driving with the guy in charge to coordinate efforts and make things happen <a href="https://twitter.com/Junkiezap" title="Azael Soriano">BalamEk</a> an interesting idea came up &hellip;..</p>

<h5>&ldquo;We are going to spend 3 weekends with this kids, why we do not try something different?&rdquo;</h5>

<p>The main idea was to get the attention of this kids at the same time participate as a team in off-school hours, and also &ldquo;we&rdquo; as volunteers will be able to understand more about their community.</p>

<h3>The brillant idea&hellip;..</h3>

<p>We bought four disposable cameras (we were a bit reduced on budget) the ones you can get on a convenience store, not really high end cameras, but it will help us to spread the kids in different teams, they will be able to work together and show their community to the world.  :)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Rogfloyd" title="Roger Romero">Roger</a> gave them a 7 minute course introduction to the whole new world of photography, showing them how to use the cameras, they were pretty excited to play for a week with the &ldquo;new toys&rdquo;.</p>
