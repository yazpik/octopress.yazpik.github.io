  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The future of the storage</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working/playing with Storage systems since almost 4 years now, it&rsquo;s been a journey understand how things works on this side, I&rsquo;m a Netapp certified engineer on SAN environments now and personally speaking it was not hard to understand the Netapp world because my background is based in Linux and working with the cli is a day to day task, so my friend Reynaldo Pineda introduced me few storage concepts and useful commands for a week and the next week I was totally by my own supporting a production environment, at the end I could blame my manager if something went wrong to put an unexperienced guy behind the controls&hellip; :) But fortunately nothing happened, well played, weeeell played.</p>

<p>Going back to my journey on storage, I learnt a lot, and I was able to manage the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; for the sysadmins,
with more experience gained I faced ugly problems that cost me valuable time with family, celebrations, weekends, hollydays, and nights a lot of nights, but finally I got the point when I can do things easily, and my level of understanding how things works no matter the infraestructure was getting better.</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_3183.JPG" width="550" height="550" title="'XamanEk'" ></p>

<p>Photo was taken during my first ride of the year, I woke up early in the morning while everybody was sleeping after new years dinner, took my motorcycle (Yamaha XT660Z Tenere) baptized as &ldquo;XamanEk&rdquo; and rode around 80km, 30% pavement 70% offroad on an exploratory route, from my wife&rsquo;s hometown to a Geothermal zone near to Tinajitas, Veracruz, It was not hard to find the place even its not in a map, just took me one stop asking people and rest was purely joy, I rode between hills, without a GPS (currently evaluating to get one), but at the end this is part of the fun of Adventure riding!</p>

<p>After a dip on crystal clear warm waters provided by mother earth, rode back with XamanEk just in time to had a lunch with the family.</p>

<p>2015 here we go!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a quick and easy guide to migrate VMWare VM&rsquo;s to OpenStack (KVM) using Redhat Enterprise 6.5</p>

<h4>Install virt-v2v</h4>

<p>The virt-v2v command converts virtual machines from a foreign hypervisor to run on KVM, managed by libvirt.</p>

<pre>
# yum install virt-v2v
</pre>


<p>Next step is create an xml file for the pool and indicate the storage path, I created a very simple xml file, like this one:</p>

<p><figure class='code'><figcaption>pool.xml</figcaption><div class='highlight'><table><tr><td class='line-numbers' aria-hidden='true'><pre><div data-line='1' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='2' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='3' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='4' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='5' class='line-number'></div><div data-line='6' class='line-number'></div></pre></td><td class='main  xml'><pre><div class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;pool</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;dir&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>virtimages<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;target&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>          <span class="nt">&lt;path&gt;</span>/home/images<span class="nt">&lt;/path&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;/target&gt;</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/pool&gt;</span>
</div></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Create an storage pool based on the xml file with virsh command and refeer the xml file</p>

<pre>
# virsh pool-create --file pool.xml
</pre>


<p>List the storage pool, &ldquo;virtimages&rdquo; pool is refering to the path given on the xml file which is /home/images</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Xacxamayo Episode 2</h4>

<p>I recently posted on my fb page about a visit to an small-remote town called Xacxamayo near to Puebla city,
Basically I was a volunteer for 3 saturdays,
I wanted to teach about other existing options on compute software, and also wanted to show them there is a world outside commercial and common programs, One of this options called Linux is currently helping in science, medicine, education and even in movies and games to not mention alot of different daylife stuff, I believe all of the kids were excited about the way I made my point.  :)</p>

<p>While driving with the guy in charge to coordinate efforts and make things happen <a href="https://twitter.com/Junkiezap" title="Azael Soriano">BalamEk</a> an interesting idea came up &hellip;..</p>

<h5>&ldquo;We are going to spend 3 weekends with this kids, why we do not try something different?&rdquo;</h5>

<p>The main idea was to get the attention of this kids at the same time participate as a team in off-school hours, and also &ldquo;we&rdquo; as volunteers will be able to understand more about their community.</p>

<h3>The brillant idea&hellip;..</h3>

<p>We bought four disposable cameras (we were a bit reduced on budget) the ones you can get on a convenience store, not really high end cameras, but it will help us to spread the kids in different teams, they will be able to work together and show their community to the world.  :)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Rogfloyd" title="Roger Romero">Roger</a> gave them a 7 minute course introduction to the whole new world of photography, showing them how to use the cameras, they were pretty excited to play for a week with the &ldquo;new toys&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/mono_coco.png" width="300" height="168" title="'Chango'" ></p>

<p>A couple of years a go, I wrote a basic troubleshooting guide for a SAN environment, but it was never shared,
I believe is a good idea to have a list of considerations to take specially when there are a ton of variables to consider, so I&rsquo;ve decided to shared this list on my blog,
If you are working on IT as Storage/Unix/Windows admin, you know how things are durig an issue on production, specially with managers, international teams when no one knows what is really going on and someone important is screaming on the phone waiting for answers.
This list has truly helped me out asking questions to easily identify what the problem is, and also helps to improve the time to response if you are ready on those critical situations.</p>

<p>So pretty much I based this guide on past experiences and vendor recommendations.</p>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s check the list</h3>

<ol>
    <h5>
<li>Do not freak out (very important)</li>
<li>Calm yourself down (breath)</li>
    </h5>

And we are ready to get the information

<ul>
<pre>
<li>What exactly the problem is? (you will need to understand the situation first)</li>
<li>What has been changed recently? (sometimes it was just a firmware update/upgrade on the host)</li>
<li>What is the scope of the problem? </li>
<li>Is Only one device/application, clustering affected?</li>
<li>Are any specific protocols or applications related to the problem?</li>
<li>Is the problem more prevalent at a given time of day or load condition?</li>
<li>Is this issue impacting reads, writes, both, or something else?</li>
<li>Is this issue persistent or only happening occasionally?</li>
</pre>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you think you already know all about virtualization, well you should have a look on this&hellip;
As you may know, there are virtualization technologies such as VMware, VirtualBox and Openstack, those technologies allow us to create Virtual machines that run on top of physical hardware, So we can create VM&rsquo;s for different purposes, capabilities and functionalities, and that was actually a big step in technology and everyone is happy with it&hellip;.</p>

<p>But if you think twice maybe you don&rsquo;t really need an entire operative system to run just an small application, and from the sysadmin point of view, there is no reason to have the overhead to virtualize an entire virtual vachine to run a L.A.M.P server, just to give you a quick example, and there is when docker comes in the game.</p>

<h3>Sysadmins vs DevOps the war has just begun&hellip;</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/docker_logo.jpg" width="625" height="275" title="'Docker'" ></p>

<p><a href="http://www.docker.com" title="Docker">Docker</a> it&rsquo;s a virtualization technology using Linux containers, let&rsquo;s say Docker use resource isolation of the Linux kernel (Cgroups and Kernel namespaces) So you can have multiple containers running on a single server, and those &ldquo;containers&rdquo; avoid the overhead of running an entire operative system, encapsulating functionalities or personalities, :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/Lucy_(2014_film)_poster.jpg" width="225" height="421" title="'Lucy Poster'" >
A bit late but I had the opportunity to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2092674329/" title="Lucy Trailer">&ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;</a>
last weekend and I really loved it, I found it pretty interesting and it deserves a long post, I believe is pure science fiction, maybe some freaky science guys are going to hate it, But it really doesn&rsquo;t matters if it&rsquo;s scientific accurate in some topics as long as Scarlett Johansson do her thing, Anyways if you enjoy this genere judge by yourself and watch it.
Here is a couple of my favourite quotes&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>The dolphin did not invent the sonar — it developed it, naturally. And this is the crucial part of our philosophical reflection we have today: can we therefore conclude that humans are more concerned with "having" than "being"?</p><footer><strong>Professor Norman</strong> <cite>Played by Morgan Freeman in the Movie “Lucy”</cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi everyone outta there, Finally I&rsquo;ve decided to start writing again after some major changes on my life, I think it would be a good idea to document my recent work/ activity/ thoughts on a blog, to have access to those memories and do a favor to myself going back in time and resolve recurrent ugly technical issues, or Why not maybe help others to do so, Anyway everything can be found on internet, and this blog is not going to be any different, for sure better and high quality technical information can be found in other sites, but somehow is going to be fun.</p>

<p>As a Sysadmin the best we can save in time the best we balance our personal lifes, And I&rsquo;ll call this part of my life &ldquo;Motivation&rdquo;
Here&rsquo;s the reason &hellip;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Naia_homeoffice.jpg" width="650" height="650" title="'Naia'" ></p>

<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter how important is the project or how high the issue that you are working on is escalated with the higher management, your little one wants to be feeded, and that&rsquo;s a huge priority as well, at least for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to post frequently about the life of a Sysadmin, Feel free to stop by and leave a comment :)</p>
